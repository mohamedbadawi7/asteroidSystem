To run this code, open the HelloApplication class in this folder and run it. The marker should see that the Space view
comes up and they are able to perform the functions such as dragging and flinging each asteroid, increasing/decreasing world roation, and stopping/starting spin and movement of asteroids.I believe all the parts of the assignment are
functioning correctly.
